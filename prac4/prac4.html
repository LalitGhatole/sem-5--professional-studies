                    <h3> SmartCity Traffic Management System</h3>
                    <p>The company developed an advanced SmartCity Traffic Management System, integrating AI-powered
                        traffic cameras and real-time data analytics to optimize traffic flow. This project successfully
                        reduced traffic congestion by 30% and improved overall road safety through automated traffic
                        signal adjustments and congestion alerts for commuters.</p>

                    <h3>EcoGuard Drone Surveillance</h3>
                    <p>The company implemented the EcoGuard Drone Surveillance system to protect wildlife in a national
                        park. This project involved deploying a fleet of autonomous drones equipped with thermal cameras
                        and AI algorithms to monitor and deter poaching activities. As a result, the project
                        significantly reduced illegal hunting and contributed to the conservation of endangered species.
